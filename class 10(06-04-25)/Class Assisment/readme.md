## Travel Planner

You are planning a world tour with your friends using a tuple of destinations. Each destination is
a tuple in the format (country, days_to_spend).

## Itinerary

itinerary = (
    ("Japan", 7),
    ("France", 5),
    ("Brazil", 6),
    ("Canada", 4),
    ("Egypt", 8),
    ("Australia", 10),
    ("Italy", 3)
)

Tasks (NO LOOPS allowed!)

### 1. Total Trip Duration

Use tuple unpacking and built-in functions to calculate the total number of days of your trip.


### 2. Midway Country

Find the middle destination (not just the middle element — the full (country, days) tuple).


### 3. Your Top 3 Longest Stays

Without looping, create a new tuple with the top 3 longest stays, sorted in descending order of days spent.


### 4. Extract All Countries

Extract the names of countries, not the days.

### 5. Check if a Country is on the List

Check if "India" is in the trip plan — return True or False.

### 6. Replace a Destination

Replace "Italy" with "Greece" (with the same number of days) and return the new tuple. Remember: tuples are immutable — you’ll need to create a new one!
